# Android Studio Application Development

This repository serves as a personal project to create an Android Studio application with an original user interface design (UID).

## Purpose

This project is primarily for personal experimentation and learning, focusing on:
- Creating and deploying an an Android Studio application.
- Implementing a custom user interface design based on sketches.
- Exploring various functionalities and productivity enhancements.

## Project Breakdown

1. **User Interface Design and Testing**
   - Documentation and visual sketches showing the evolution of the app's user interface (UI) design.
   
2. **Android Application Files**
   - Core files and configuration details required to run the application.
  
## Android Application Files

The main Android application files are organized within the `MyApplication` directory, which contains configuration files, source code, and test files. 

## Sketches

All sketches related to the appâ€™s user interface design are located in the `Sketches` folder within the `app_design` directory. These images capture the planning and layout concepts for the UI.
